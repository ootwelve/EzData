# EzData
EzData is an amateur project to manage SQLite via terminal. It doesn't provide GUI (by now) and isn't actually that easy (although the name suggests), considering that there are many other SQLite solutions with GUI and tons of features, but the main objective of the software is just getting experience.

# Requirements
Python; <br>
Python's sqlite3 library.
